## About The Project
### Context
This project is a front-end challenge designed by Alura.

The goal is to develop the html and css from the scratch (making sure to add layout responsiveness) and to develop functionalities to the web page using javascript or frameworks according to customer needs. 
### Challenge
The company AluraGeek needs to bring more customers and increase its sales, so they want to implement an e-commerce and take the company to the next level, becoming more digital.
Therefore, they are asking for our help as developers to create the website and the e-commerce must contain the following requirements:
* A homepage that contains a "login" button and a search engine for products offered by the company.
* A banner that contains discounts, promotions, or information relevant to the moment.
* A gallery with product information such as: image, product name, price and a link to the product description page.
* A product page that contains the image, name, description, and price.
* A footer with a contact form and other relevant information.
* Admin menu so they can add, edit, search or delete products from the store.

__It is very important that the website is responsive__ to give customers the ease of shopping through mobile devices.
